I am a coder from Indonesia, living and working in Jakarta.
I've ever worked with spring-boot for building backend-services.
I like network security, particularly in the areas of secure protocols, privacy, and anonymity.
I am relatively active in developing open-source software and I believe in writing clean, modular code.
I am regularly blogging about technology.
