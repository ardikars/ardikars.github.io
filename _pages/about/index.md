I am a coder from Indonesia, living and working in Jakarta.
I've ever worked with the spring-boot framework for building backend-services.

I like network security, particularly in the areas of secure protocols, privacy, and anonymity.
I am active in developing open-source software and believe in writing clean, modular, and maintainable code.
I am regularly blogging about technology.
